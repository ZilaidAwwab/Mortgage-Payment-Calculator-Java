# Mortgage-Payment-Calculator-Java
A small program to calculate the mortgage payment.

# Description
User has to input the Principal Amount, the interest rate and the number of years for the loan and the program will output the monthly payment amount.

# Formula
The formula for calculating this is:
M = P (i(1 + i)^n) / (1 + i)^n - 1

Here,
M = Monthly Payment
P = Principal Amount
i = Interest Rate
  (Since we want to generate the monthly payment so we are going to generate the monthly interest rate).

n = Number of Payments
  (This is number of years for the loan divided by 12)
